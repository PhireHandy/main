== Introduction

FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students of all fields who prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards, as well as teachers who would like to provide resources (in the form of custom flashcard decks) to support their students’ learning.

FlashCard Pro is optimised for users who are comfortable with Command Line Interface-based interaction, allowing them to work more efficiently than with traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based flashcard apps, while still being able to use their flashcards in a familiar GUI format.

== Flashcards

What is a flashcard? Flashcards are containers for information. Each card has a “front” and a “back”. Although FlashCard Pro is agnostic in its implementation, one recommended use case is such: the user stores a question on the “front” of the card and the answer on the “back”.

After sets of flashcards (known as “decks”) have been created, the user may interact with the flashcards in various ways. For example, FlashCard Pro can be configured to show the “front” of the card, prompting the user to enter their guess for what is on the “back” of the card. The user’s attempt is gauged “correct” if it matches the definition of the card.

As with physical flashcards, the flashcards in FlashCard Pro can be shuffled, used in reverse, mixed between decks, etc. Unlike physical flashcards, flashcards in FlashCard Pro are dynamic, offering a range of possibilities from traditional memorisation-type uses to support for learning programming.

For example, teachers may define basic coding problems which their students can attempt to answer. FlashCard Pro will evaluate the output of the student’s solution, allowing students to gauge their own coding knowledge, and teachers to evaluate their students’ progress.

[TIP]
You can share the deck of cards in the JSON file saved to another user to use in FlashCard Pro via the `import` function.+
Refer to <<Importing flashcards from disk : `import`>> for steps.

[TIP]
You are advised to save your FlashCard Pro decks of flashcards in a folder that is separate from your files. +
FlashCard Pro recommends createing a folder in desktop named `flashcardpro`.

=== Viewing flashcards in library: `view`

=== Create new empty deck: `create`

Creates an empty deck in FlashCard Pro library.

Format: `create deck/DECK_NAME.

Note :

****
* The `DECK_NAME` must be unique and no deck that exist in FlashCard Pro library should have the same name of `DECK_NAME`.

* If there is another deck with the same name `DECK_NAME`, there will be an error message and the empty deck will not be created.
****

Examples:

* `create deck/german` +

Creates a new empty deck named `german`.


=== Add new Front Back card or Multiple Choice Card to deck: `add`

Format: `create deck/DECK_NAME [priority/PRIORITY_LEVEL] front/FRONT_TEXT back/BACK_TEXT [choice/CHOICE_TEXT]...`

****
* The `DECK_NAME` must be a name of an existing deck in FlashCard Pro.

** If there is not deck with the name of `DECK_NAME`, there will be an error message and the card will not be created.

* When entering the `PRIORITY_LEVEL`, there are only 2 valid choices `HIGH` and `LOW`. Refer to the table below to know how to use the `PRIORITY_LEVEL`:

[width="59%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Priority | Value | Input for PRIORITY_LEVEL

| High | You find the card important and want it to be tested more often | `HIGH`

| Low | You find the card less important and want it to be tested less often | `LOW`
|=======================================================================

** If no `priority/` parameter is entered, then the default priority level is `LOW`.

** If you enter any input other than `HIGH` or `LOW`, there will be an error message and the card will not be created.

* `FRONT_TEXT` is the question that you wish to see in the flashcard.

* To create a Front Back card,

** `BACK_TEXT` is the answer of the Front Back flashcard.

** No choice should be entered under `choice/`.

* To create a Multiple Choice card,

** the `BACK_TEXT` parameter should correspond to choice entered by the user, using the order of choice entered and should be a integer value from 1, 2, ...., Number of choices entered.

** To create a Multiple Choice card, there should be at least 2 `choice/` parameters entered.
